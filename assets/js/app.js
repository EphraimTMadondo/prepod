Working with Beki 'Butch Cassidy' Mbambo is a refreshing experience. His willingness to consider and deliver my needs as a client is 
matched by his willingness to offer advice on bringing about the best vocal performace. In all my experiences with him I recevie not 
only a mixed and mastered product but some creative additions as well which usually transform the song to a
great place I would have never imagined on my own. I believe these strengths come from his experiences as an artist himself.


Right There

I seee you glow in the sunlight
You're a song that I wrote that I still write 
That means the love don't pass
As the sand falls down the hour-glass
Let's take a cruise don't crash
Memories in my bag I unpack from the past
All I really want is now
The present moment I notice is ours
Sun goes and the wind blows
